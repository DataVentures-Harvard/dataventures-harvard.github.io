> We're dedicated to creating a community of data scientists and analysts here at Harvard. 


### Goals

Our goals are:

1. Teach students the necessarily skills they need to hit the ground running (both theoretical and practical skills)
2. Organize speakers and talks from a variety of discipline.
3. Tackle data science projects from the industry.

###  Membership

We have two different kinds of members:

#### Trainees

Trainees are students that are comping the club in order to learn data science skills. They're not directly involved with Projects, but after a semester of training they'll be placed on projects so they can start to practice their new knowledge.

#### Fellows

Fellows are talented and experience data scientists, who have already used data science in internships, research projects, or elsewhere. They have a variety of roles within Data Ventures, but make up the core of the Projects team.
